# NOTE: This list was purely made by me running pacman -Q and writing down all the important stuff I saw.
# If anything's missing, make a issue and inform me or make a PR. :)
#
# This also won't include system packages you should already have like linux-firmware and microcodes. Get those yourself you lazy shit.
